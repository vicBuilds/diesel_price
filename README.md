# diesel_price
This is a project a microservice to fetch diesel price from all the state and UT in India and send to a endpoint.

### Important Note:
1. My limited request to fetch all states data got exhausted while testing so I was forced to fetch only a single state's data to demonstate the proper working of the app. I rewrote a major part of the code to change the URL and to handle the response data. 

2. if we also want to show the response in UI which will currently not be shown(The requirement is not as such currently). I can up rewrite and revamp the code. 
 For that purpose we need to write a server using express and send the data in res(The async function will have req,res in the argument then).
